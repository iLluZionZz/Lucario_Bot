"# Lucario_Bot" 
Lucario Bot is a private Discord Bot made for a Pokemon Discord community. 
Although its use is private, its code is completely open sourced. If you care to use it- or blatantly rebrand it; is up to you. The github commits are not a complete representation of the bots functionality anyways.

Some of its features include:
Basic Server Moderation
Music Playing
Basic Economy System
A Pokemon Minigame similar to PokeMeow

Currently, the bot does not feature a slash command handler.


Some of its commands are unfinished, and may be out of date with the current packages it uses.

The .ENV file MUST contain:
PREFIX - The prefix used for the bot.
MONGODB_SRV - Token for logging into mongoDB 
DISCORD_TOKEN - Bot Token for logging onto discord

Read package.json for the required installed packages in order to run.
