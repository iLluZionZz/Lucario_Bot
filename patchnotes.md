<p>A few commands were removed. I won't be covering them all here. Most of them were causing bugs I couldn't fix myself, and some may return in the future once documentation gets a bit more descriptive then it current is.<br />

#### Squashed Bugs:
-Any commands that called for emojis could possibly crash the bot if they weren't already cached, so we've rectified that by preloading the emojis as the bot starts.

#### New Additions:

-The Profile command has been updated to include prestige levels, reputation, Pokemon connection codes & more. Trying to expand the economy profiles of everyone as wide as I can to bring together the community and other aspects of the bot.
-Added a Trading Card lookup command to find prices on cards and display them within embeds
-Added all of generation 8 Pokemon names to pokemon.txt
-Added usage keys/hints to important or difficult to understand commands
